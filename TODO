- Update to allow the user to specify a playlist either by ID or name. If using a name, take the first found.
  - It just looks nicer.

- Allow the directory-path to be a template, and allow the playlist-name to be replaced into it.
- Need to be able to add public playlists, too. Allow the search to default to this but to allow for a "--mine" parameter.

- Add a command-line tool to do a manual preauth.
